Repository for following courses on NomadCoders

> TYPECHAIN
## Learned:
1. Typescript basics
  - type assignment for variables/parameters, return types
  - class/interface to declare (much reminiscence to C++ and Java ðŸ¥²)
2. Little bit of Crypto blockchaining !
  - no real application-grade material here, but was a good opportunity to review concepts of blockchain
