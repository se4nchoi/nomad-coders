Repository for following courses on NomadCoders

## TYPECHAIN
> Learned:
1. Typescript basics
  - type assignment for variables/parameters, return types
  - class/interface to declare (much reminiscence to C++ and Java ðŸ¥²)
2. Little bit of Crypto blockchaining !
  - no real application-grade material here, but was a good opportunity to review concepts of blockchain


## Next.js - Intro
> Learned:
1. Differences between a Next (React framework) and React (UI library)
  - Since my first encounter with React, this course taught me that there is a difference between a framework built on React and React itself! -- And that Next.js tries to solve many inconveniences by providing an opinionated way to write React apps (which I can appreciate very much ðŸ¤£)
2. Next js core concepts
  - Pages/routes structure and the template of _app.js 
  - Using the next.config.js to play with URL rewrites/redirects
  - SSR, CSR and a sneak-peek into how to work with routers 
  - Router tricks in passing query values and *masking* it from the user (hiding API keys and de-cluttering URLs)
  
3. Getting open-source API data to play with, from [the movie DB](https://api.themoviedb.org) !
